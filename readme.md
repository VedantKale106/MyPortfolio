## 🕯️ Enter If You Dare

I am a 21-year-old survivor from the shadows of **Junnar**, currently haunting **Pune**. I am in my final year of dark arts (Computer Science) at **PCCOE**.

I build nightmares with code, strengthen the flesh vessel at the gym, and silence the mind against the void.

### 💀 The Survivor's Journal
* **Sustenance:** I track my intake religiously to maintain this mortal form. **80g of protein** is the daily sacrifice. 💪
* **Philosophy:** I follow **Stoicism**. I remain cold and unshakeable in the face of chaos. 🧠

## ⚰️ The Grimoire (Tech Stack)

I use these forbidden tools to conjure my creations:

* **Incantations:** Python, C++, SQL
* **Dark Magic:** Flask, HTML, CSS
* **Torture Devices:** Docker, Git, VS Code

---

## 🕸️ Dark Rituals (Projects)

Manifestations I have summoned from the abyss:

* **Flesh Consumption (KayKhau):** A roulette for the starving. Discover your next meal before it discovers you.
* **Ghost Whispers (LoveMail):** Send anonymous confessions from the void. They'll never know it was you.
* **Plague Doctor (MediScan):** AI that predicts the rot before it consumes the host.
* **Cursed Map (PuneJourney):** Navigate the haunted ruins and hidden alleys of the city.
