## 🏛️ A Quiet Entrance

This is not a résumé.  
This is not a portfolio.  
This is a place where thoughts are stored and occasionally questioned.

I live an ordinary life.  
I wake up, I work, I train, I eat, I sleep.  
Nothing remarkable — and therefore, everything essential.

## 📜 Fragment I — The Cup

A man complained that his cup was broken.

Another man laughed and said,
*"I knew the cup was broken the moment I started using it."*

Both drank water.
Only one was angry.

## 📜 Fragment II — Control

There are three kinds of events:
1. Those I control
2. Those I influence
3. Those that do not know I exist

Most suffering comes from arguing with the third.

## 📜 Fragment III — The Gym at 6 AM

At 6 AM the gym is silent.

No music.  
No mirrors.  
No one watching.

The body moves.
The mind follows.
Ego does not enter.

This is philosophy with sweat.

## 📜 Fragment IV — The Observer

When I feel anxious, I ask:
*"Who is observing this feeling?"*

The observer is calm.
The feeling fades.

## 📜 Fragment V — The Market

In the marketplace, people trade money for objects.
Quietly, they trade time for approval.

I try not to shop for either.

## 📜 Fragment VI — A Small Story

A student asked his teacher:
*"What should I read to become wise?"*

The teacher replied:
*"Read less. Observe more."*

The student was disappointed.
Years later, he understood.

## 🧭 Exit

If you found meaning here, it came from you — not from these words.

Return to your work.
Return to your body.
Return to the present moment.
